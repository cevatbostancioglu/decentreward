# What is our cost ? 

- Smart contract platform fee's(gas)
- Link payments and Link TVS vs Smart Contract TVL cost
- Asset management smart contract execution payments
- Twitter API fee's(for enterprise level API subscription)
- Operation costs(bot, website)

# How are we gonna cover all of them ? 

- L1 fee's will be chepear with L2 solutions
- Protocol can provide Web2 API endpoint to all Web3 platforms to earn more $Link and cover TVS across multiple chains
- Using L2's will significantly reduce smart contract layer fee.
- Cut some percentage of reward/giveaway to save L1 fee's and operation/development costs.
- Create DON of networks and load balance twitter api requests across DONNs.
- Operation cost is not all that much high, its working on Intel NUC and bot uses Twitter API to communicate with all the users. Security costs and attack surfaces are significantly reduced with this architecture.
